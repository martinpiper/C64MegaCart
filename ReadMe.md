# C64 Open source cartridges and programmers


## C64MegaCart V2.0

* 2 Megabyte of Flash memory
* Flash can be erased, either the whole memroy or smaller banks, and written by the C64
* When ordering 100 units, each unit should cost about USD 10, excluding shipping and import taxes.
* Can be ordered direct from PCBWay: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Commodore_64_MegaCart_V2_2MB_ae46e34b.html
* Code that demonstrates flash memory erase and write, with cartridge bank kill functionality: https://github.com/martinpiper/C64MegaCart/blob/main/FlashWriteTest.a

## Cartridge programmer tool

* This is a Raspberry Pi hat
* Software running on the Raspberry Pi can erase, write, and read the flash memory
* It multiplexes signals to increase the number of inputs and outputs, allowing the full range of Commodore 64 expansion port signals to be controlled
* It uses MOSFETs to drive higher currents at higher frequencies
* Can be ordered direct from PCBWay: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/C64_Cartridge_programming_tool_V2_4b4c9cff.html
* Raspberry Pi source code for the programmer is here: https://github.com/martinpiper/C64MegaCart/tree/main/PiCartTool

## About PCB assembly costs

PCBWay have fixed assembly and fabrication setup fees, so when ordering a small number of units these fees increase per unit cost. The best way to reduce the impact of setup fees is to order more units, in bulk.
