* Currently there is one 8-bit latch for the whole bank register, in IO1
	At power on, after _RESET, _GAME is high and _EXROM is low, giving 8KB ROML based cartridge
	Adding another register in IO2 will allow the _GAME and _EXROM lines to be controlled
	* It would be possible to set _GAME low and have _EXROM high (from IO2 register) only when A15 is set and R_W is low and when RGAME (IO2 register control GAME bit) is high and PHI2 is high
		This would give ultimax mode and allow writes to $e000-$ffff to control the address (plus IO1 bank register) and data lines lines to the flash _WE (_RWE i.e. ROM _WE) signal
		_ROMH would go straight to _RWE
	Page 37 https://www.mouser.sg/datasheet/2/12/M29FxxFT_FB-2999423.pdf says "Bus Read operations from any address always read the Status Register during Program
and Erase operations."
	>> Note: During Program operations the Data Polling Bit outputs the complement of the bit being programmed to DQ7. After successful completion of the Program operation the
memory returns to Read mode and Bus Read operations from the address just programmed output DQ7, not its complement.
