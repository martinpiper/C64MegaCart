	Output
		D0..7
		A0..15
		LATOUT0	=> _LATOUT0
		RWE		=> _RWE
		_IO1
		_IO2
		PHI2
		R_W
		_ROML
		_ROMH
		>> 32 signals in total with the above optionals
		_RESET

	Input
		D0..7
		RYBY
		>> 8/9 signals
	* Need to optionally tri-state the data output to allow reading the result from the external memory
	* Test hardware:
		>> Appropriate level shifters 3.3V to 5V
		>> 8 signals for data in
		>> 8 signals for data out
		>> 5 x 74LS373 or 74LS374
			> Each would need a signal, no real need for a decoder (74LS138) since signals are not a limiting factor
		>> 5 signals for latch select, multiple latches can be set at the same time
		>> 25 signals
	* Note: The output latch must not be default to output, it must guard against logic contentions with the cart memory
		U5 defaults to clear, for the cartridge _RESET

	* Done: Game and exrom can be read
		PGAME and PEXROM through the level shifters, for safety
	* And bigger holes on headers
		Using S-80-40 from the CONN-DIL40
	* Done: Also try to find a part for a better cart connector that can be soldered.
	* Done: And match the Pi pin out, the Pi has pins pointing upwards...
	* Check the header pins are long, they seem to be short at the moment...

* C64MegaCartV3: Specifically apply net to all edge connectors



* MegaCart V2.0
	* Board edge for cart case, maybe a bit wider after the edge connector
	* Done : Central mounting hole, for cart case

	* Done: Chamfer card edge
	* Done: _EXROM disable logic
		* Software enable/disable _EXROM write $80 to $dfxx
			Defaults to $00 (enabling _EXROM = 0)
	* Done: Flash write logic
		* Flash write sequence:
			Run code in RAM at 0-$fff
			Write 8K bank using $dexx
			$dfxx = $40 : _EXROM=0 and REQFLASH=1
			Write erase chip/bank command bytes to $e000-$ffff
			Read status from $8000-$9fff, until $ff, repeat if needed
			Write program command bytes to $e000-$ffff
			Write final data to $e000-$ffff range
			Read back correct final data from $8000-$9fff, retry if needed
	>> While V1.0 had a separate pad for _RWE to allow fast programming (flash write), the C64 had no access to the signal via the expansion port, V2.0 has programming (flash write) coming from _ROMH directly.
		This means the C64 can assert _ROMH (via the REQFLASH mechanism which leads to _GAME), or the fast programmer can assert _ROMH directly without needing to set REQFLASH.
	> CartTool works
	> C64 cart bank works, as well as the kill control
	> C64 flash write also works, under two seconds to write 8KB of erased flash.
	* Use proper kernal address :)
	>> Block erase works. The BOM uses a M29F160FT55N3E2, which is (according to page 8 of the datasheet) is a "top boot block" version, which has a 8KB block at $1fa000
		This equates to setting bank $fd before issuign the block erase.



* CartTool V2: Remove power plug


* CartTool V2: Add stock codes for resistors and LEDs



* CartTool V2: Push button switch to ground

* CartTool V2: Move the Pi connector to the bottom left, so the USB stacked plugs do not hit the PCB




* CartTool V2: Level convertors can be replaced with on-board circuitry

* C64MegaCart V4.0: Based on an intended cart case, the PCB needs to be a little narrower, the hole a little larger and moved up away from the edge connector a little.
	>> 57mm wide
		Was -29.210mm to 29.210mm
		Not -28.210mm to 28.210mm = 56.42mm and Y=-23.3mm
	>> 6mm internal peg, moved up 3mm
		X=0mm Y=22mm
	>> And made taller to Y=58.9mm



* C64MegaCart V4.1: 
	Done: Pin edge connector, too narrow, return to using the V2.0 width.
	Done: Corner can be a bit longer, but no futher than third of the edge connector.
	Done: Top edge max Y = 2.325in Current = 1.5in Right click->on corner green box->Move to
	Done: Above the edge connector, make narrower, 4.0 was too narrow.
	Done: Remove silk screen around DIL holes
		Done: Move holes to above edge connector
		Done: Make holes smaller, no pads, just vias: Using: C-30-15
	Done: Mounting hole center was good from 4.0, but too large. 4.5mm better?
		Done: Move to mounting hole layer
		Done: Make unplated
		
		
		
		
* MegaCart V4.2:
	Bottom board edge connector width move down a little...
	Hole move down ~1.5mm so that the card edge connector is flush with the bottom of the case
	Check with model
	>> Remove copper between edge connector

		Inside hole-> bottom.Groove001.Sketch027
		End post nubbin... bottom->Cone and Cylinder inside hole
	* Bottom case pillar would be better with a smaller than PCB ring, then the larger than PCB hole piller
		And then the pillar from the top meeting the bottom
		Current outer radius is 3mm on the top and 3.08mm on the bottom
		Current bottom is 2.62mm away from the top
