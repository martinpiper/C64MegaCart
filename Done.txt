* Programming hardware
	Output
		D0..7
		A0..15
		LATOUT0	=> _LATOUT0
		RWE		=> _RWE
		_IO1
		_IO2
		PHI2
		R_W
		_ROML
		_ROMH
		>> 32 signals in total with the above optionals
		_RESET

	Input
		D0..7
		RYBY
		>> 8/9 signals
	* Need to optionally tri-state the data output to allow reading the result from the external memory
	* Test hardware:
		>> Appropriate level shifters 3.3V to 5V
		>> 8 signals for data in
		>> 8 signals for data out
		>> 5 x 74LS373 or 74LS374
			> Each would need a signal, no real need for a decoder (74LS138) since signals are not a limiting factor
		>> 5 signals for latch select, multiple latches can be set at the same time
		>> 25 signals
	* Note: The output latch must not be default to output, it must guard against logic contentions with the cart memory
		U5 defaults to clear, for the cartridge _RESET

	* Done: Game and exrom can be read
		PGAME and PEXROM through the level shifters, for safety
	* And bigger holes on headers
		Using S-80-40 from the CONN-DIL40
	* Done: Also try to find a part for a better cart connector that can be soldered.
	* Done: And match the Pi pin out, the Pi has pins pointing upwards...
	* Check the header pins are long, they seem to be short at the moment...

	* Done: Add debug header for the cartridge, large holes again
	* Done: Add power socket, LED, capacitors
	* Done: Add four indicator LEDs connected to the last latch
